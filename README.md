# Hand_Gesture_Controlled_Mouse
Gesture controlled virtual mouse is a virtual mouse that is based on virtual reality that is used to 
act real by acknowledging the gesture of the person who is using the concept. This project is 
used to detect the movement of hands and the fingers. I have used PyCharm which is 
compatible with Window, Linux, MacOS platforms. IDLE is Python's Integrated Development 
and Learning Environment. It allows programmers to easily write Python code. Just like Python 
Shell, IDLE can be used to execute a single statement and create, modify, and execute Python 
scripts. I had also gained an insight of how and why HCI is used, so, basically itâ€™s a concept 
that is used to check that how much computers are prepared to interact with humans and use to 
check the development process of the machineries, also as time evolves there is a need of userfriendly user interface which has to be provided to the user while connected to the devices, this 
has to be evolved with machinery evolution. 
Some concepts used for making the gesture control virtual mouse project are:
1.) AI stands for artificial intelligence it is based on the concept to make machine think and work 
the way humans can. The word artificial intelligence is bifurcated into two the first part artificial 
means man-made and intelligence means thinking power, so the word artificial intelligence means 
man made things having thinking power. The concept of AI has been introduced by a question that 
CAN MACHINE THINK? Artificial intelligence uses the concept of NLP that is one of the core 
areas of AI and stands for natural language processing and is responsible for making machine 
capable of understanding the human spoken words and written text. Artificial intelligence also 
uses the concept of machine learning that allocate the learning mechanism to the machine. 
2.) OpenCV stands for Open-Source Computer Vision Library, by knowing the full form of 
OpenCV that is used for computer visions machine learning and processing of images. This library 
is useful in detecting objects handwriting and faces of a human. NumPy is one of the most used
Python modules that is used with OpenCV.
3.) NumPy stands for numerical Python which is used to do numerical based work on arrays, 
generally we use list with Python, but they are slow so by using NumPy with Python we make the 
use of array which helps to work 50x times faster than list as the data is stored in a contiguous 
memory allocation in arrays, which makes the accessing and manipulation of data elements easier 
and faster.

Hardware and software:
a.) We required a monitor or a PC having access of web camera.
b.) We will be using a platform for running our program that is Python IDLE.
c.) We will be using Python programming language as it is extensible, simple, and provides large 
set of libraries and functions to perform a task very simply.
d.) OpenCV (open-source computer vision library) is a library that is used for real time work.
